# APBS analysis tools
Here, we'll put some useful analysis tools that we have developed working with APBS. 

`get_dx.py` is a script to automize of APBS runs on a folder with PDBs, with interactive visualization of electrostatic potentials using MDAnalysis. Check out `test.ipynb` for a simple tutorial.
